# Project: Image Classifier<br>
## Udacity Machine Learning Introduction Nanodegree<br>
### Deep Learning Module<br>

The aim of this project was to train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. The project is divided into two sections:
• correctly train a classifier (solution: see .html or .ipynb file).
• write an application that would allow a user to train the classifier and apply it to a new image (solution: .py files).

#### Software and Libraries
This project uses the following software and python libraries: <br>
numpy,  pandas, torch, matplotlib, seaborn, PIL
